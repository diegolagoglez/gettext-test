Project to test translate toolkit (gettext).

Source code is in English. Make command starts translation into Spanish
(but must be translated manually and then compiled and then installed).

Program takes LANG environment variable to show translated strings. If
not translated strings found, it uses English. In order to test if
Spanish is working, launch it as:

LANG=es_ES ./gettext-test

Localization files for this program should be saved in:

./locale/es_ES/LC_MESSAGES

Folder is relative to the folder the program is launched.
